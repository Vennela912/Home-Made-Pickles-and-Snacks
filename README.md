# Home-Made-Pickles-and-Snacks

The HomeMade Pickles & Snacks project is a mini e-commerce web application developed using Flask (Python-based web framework), aimed at showcasing and selling home-made pickles and snacks. The application provides users with an interactive shopping experience, allowing them to browse a product catalog, add items to a cart, and place orders using Cash on Delivery (COD). 
The project is fully AWS-ready, integrated with key cloud services to ensure scalability, reliability, and real-world deployment capabilities.
